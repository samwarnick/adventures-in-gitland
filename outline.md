1. Merge Conflicts with Integration

2. Bipassing the Broken Build - Inspired by Ellery Davila

   Sneak back locally to the spot where *everyone else* went wrong. Then branch! Branch off through the jungle, swinging from the trees and commit to your new journey. You'll find yourself on a familiar path, but this time, no one will be with you. Continue on this path and never look back. Eventually, years down the road you may come back to your old friends stuck at the roadblock but don't worry about that. Getting up to speed with long lost colleagues is never hard...unless you had conflicts.
